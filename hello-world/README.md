# Hello World

This is a starter application. It contains a basic manifest file with no
additional permissions. The manifest denotes the launch_path, unlike Google's 
packaged app infrastructure there is no background script that needs to be loaded.

detailed below:

{
  "name": "Hello World",
  "description": "Hello World",
  "launch_path": "/index.html",
  "icons": {
      "128": "icon_128.png"
  },
